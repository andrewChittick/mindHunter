		<p>Wendy and Holden have returned to their hotel in Miami.  Wendy receives a phone call from Bill.</p>
		<p class="holdenA">What did Bill want?</p>
		<p class="wendyA">He said he needed to stay home for longer.  I think we can finish without him.</p>
		<p class="holdenA">This is unbelievable, it's like he doesn't even want to be a mind hunter.  Did you tell him about the break in the case?</p>
		<p class="wendyA">No, I didn't want to get into it over the phone.</p>
