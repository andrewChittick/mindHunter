		<p class="holdenA">Wendy, I would like to introduce you to my friend from the academy Agent Jodie Foster.</p>
		<p>Agent Foster-"Friend seems like a stretch."</p>
		<p class="holdenA">Thats what she said.</p>
		<p>Agent Foster-"I believe I know Hannibals location, we must act immediately to catch him."</p>
		<p class="wendyA">Bill just called me and wants to know if he should join us or just stay home.  I think we could use his help.</p>
		<p>Agent Foster-"Waiting for him would be a bad idea."</p>
		<p class="holdenA">Why let him share our glory, let him stay home.</p>
